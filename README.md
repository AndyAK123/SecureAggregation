# SecureAggregation

An implementation of Secure Aggregation algorithm based on "Practical Secure Aggregation for Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning
(Bonawitz et. al)" in Python.

Dependencies: Flask, socketio and socketIO_client

`pip install Flask`
`pip install socketio`
`pip install pip install socketIO-client`

This implementation contains a hardcoded example where all weights some upto zero. To change that, weights need to be passed to algorithm from the main model.
